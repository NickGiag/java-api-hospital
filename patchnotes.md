    v1.0.0 
    At this stage I am only using restfull http request to GET, POST, 
    PUT and DELETE information. 

    Customers can find doctors and close appointments
    -created Customers , Doctors , Appointments
    -created Users for future authorization plan
    
    -tested CRUD http methods for each, 
    appointments need to implemented in a different way to
    connect doctors and customers.
